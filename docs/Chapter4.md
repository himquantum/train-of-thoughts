# Chapter 4: What is love ?

As the train hurtled forward, Isabella's attention was momentarily drawn to a couple sitting a few rows ahead. They were kissing tenderly, their shared moment of intimacy standing out against the otherwise mundane background of the train's interior. She turned to Dr. Kent, a thoughtful look in her blue eyes.

"Do you believe in love, Dr. Kent?" she asked, her voice soft but insistent.

Dr. Kent, who had been lost in thought about their earlier discussions, was caught off guard. He had never been asked such a question before, especially not in the context of his scientific world. His mind raced through the principles of biology and chemistry that he understood so well, but none of them seemed to provide a satisfactory answer to Isabella's question.

"Does science believe in love?" she continued, not waiting for his first response.

Kent cleared his throat, feeling the weight of her gaze. "Well, from a scientific standpoint, what we call 'love' is essentially a series of biochemical reactions in the brain. Hormones like oxytocin and dopamine play a significant role. Oxytocin, often called the 'love hormone,' is released during physical touch, which strengthens social bonds and feelings of attachment. Dopamine, on the other hand, is associated with the pleasure and reward centers of the brain, giving us that euphoric feeling when we are with someone we love."

Isabella listened intently, her eyes narrowing slightly as she processed his explanation. "So, according to you, love is just a chemical reaction?"

Kent hesitated. "It's not just a chemical reaction, Isabella. While chemistry plays a vital role in the feelings we associate with love, it doesn't diminish the experience itself. The biochemical processes are part of how we experience the world. They influence our emotions and behaviors significantly."

"But don't you think that reduces something as profound as love to mere chemistry?" Isabella countered, her voice carrying a hint of frustration. "Love is not just about chemicals. It's about connection, sacrifice, and something deeper that science can't fully explain."

Kent looked at her, intrigued by the passion in her voice. "I understand that perspective. However, science doesn't necessarily reduce the experience. It provides one lens through which we can understand it. Just because we can explain the mechanism behind love doesn't mean we take away its beauty or its importance."

Isabella shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips. "You know, many philosophers have spoken about love as the most profound human experience. Plato, for instance, described love as a ladder of ascent toward the divine. According to him, physical attraction is just the beginning, leading eventually to a higher understanding and connection with the divine essence of beauty and goodness."

Isabella let out a soft sigh. “Science is remarkable, no doubt. It explains so much. The laws of physics, the mechanics of the universe… but it fails to give love its due credit.”

Harrison tilted his head slightly. “ I wouldn’t say science ignores love, just that it explains it differently.”

“That’s exactly my point,” Isabella countered, turning to face him. “It reduces love to mere molecules—dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin. But is that all it really is?”

Harrison smiled. “Are you suggesting love is something mystical, beyond our understanding?”

“Not mystical,” she said, shaking her head. “But it’s more than just chemistry. Love has inspired poets, warriors, and entire civilizations. It has led people to create and destroy. It’s a force that moves humanity. Science doesn’t capture that.”

He considered her words. “You mean it’s not just a feeling, but a fundamental force like gravity?”

“Well, In a way, I understand the gravity of this claim,” she chuckled at her wordplay.

“Let me tell you about Plato's Symposium, a philosophical dialogue written by Plato, is set at a drinking party where Socrates, Aristophanes, and other notable philosophers engage in a series of speeches about the nature of love. Each participant offers a unique perspective, exploring different facets of love and its significance in human life.

The Symposium delves into various aspects of love, including physical attraction, spiritual connection, and the pursuit of wisdom. It raises questions about the nature of beauty, the role of love in relationships, and the ultimate goal of human existence.”

“Dr. Kent \!” Isabella said, her eyes lighting up. “Let me explain how they saw love. Socrates, through Diotima, argued that love is not just physical desire but a longing for beauty and truth. Love pushes us to understand the world and ourselves better. It’s a pursuit, not just a feeling.”

She leaned forward, her voice gaining passion. “Love, according to Diotima, is a spiritual ascent. It starts with attraction to physical beauty, but if we allow it, it takes us higher—to love for wisdom, virtue, and eventually a connection with the divine. Love is not just about desire; it’s a force that elevates us.”

Harrison listened, intrigued. “So love isn’t an end in itself, but a process?”

“Exactly,” Isabella said. “Plato saw love as a guide to personal growth. Love compels us to strive for virtue, wisdom, and moral excellence. It’s what pushes people to become better versions of themselves.”

Harrison tapped his fingers on the table thoughtfully. “That’s an interesting perspective. But what about beauty? Science explains attraction as evolutionary preference—symmetry, health, genetics.”

Isabella shook her head. “Plato saw beauty differently. He argued that beauty is a reflection of higher truths. The appreciation of physical beauty is just the beginning. From there, we learn to see beauty in ideas, in justice, in knowledge. The highest form of beauty isn’t something tangible—it’s the abstract concept of the ‘Beautiful Itself.’”

Harrison smirked. “That sounds rather idealistic.”

“Maybe,” she admitted. “But consider this—philosophy itself is the highest form of love. Consider yourself as an example, Dr. Kent. Your love for physics is what turned you into a scientist, isn't it ?

Without waiting for an argument, Isabella continued..

The ultimate pursuit of love isn’t just another person. It’s wisdom. Love is the desire to understand, to seek truth. That’s why Eros, the god of love, is tied to philosophy in Plato’s work.”

Harrison crossed his arms. “So, in this view, love is the driving force behind intellectual curiosity?”

“Yes\!” Isabella said excitedly. “Love is what makes us ask questions, what makes us seek meaning. It’s what fuels both romance and knowledge.”

She paused, then continued, “And then there’s another philosopher named Aristophanes. His speech in Symposium is famous for the idea of soulmates—that humans were once whole, but the gods split them apart, and now we search for our missing half. It’s a beautiful metaphor for why we long for deep connections.”

Harrison exhaled, taking it all in. “So love is many things. A force for growth, a pursuit of wisdom, a longing for completion.”

“Exactly,” Isabella said softly. “And beyond that, love is our way of achieving immortality. Diotima described love as a ladder of progress—from fleeting mortal desires to lasting ideas, to wisdom that transcends time. Through love, we create—whether it’s children, art, or philosophy. We leave something behind that outlives us.”

Harrison was quiet for a moment. He had spent his life in the realm of empirical evidence, but Isabella’s words gave him a different perspective. Through her explanation, love transformed from a biochemical reaction into something grander—a force that shaped human history, thought, and progress.

Kent said thoughtfully. "That's  fascinating. In a way, it's similar to how science seeks to understand the universe. We start with what we can observe and measure, but there's always more beyond the surface, deeper truths waiting to be discovered."

Isabella's smile widened, her voice had a taunting tone "You know, Dr. kent. Love is not something that can be fully captured by scientific terms. It's an experience, a journey. It's the force that drives us to be better, to connect with others, and to find meaning in our lives. Without love, life feels empty and purposeless."

Kent leaned back, his eyes reflecting the dim light of the train carriage. "I've never really thought about it that way. I suppose I've been so focused on the empirical world that I've neglected the more abstract, but equally important, aspects of human experience."

"That's understandable, Mr. Scientist," Isabella said gently. "Your work is incredibly important, and it requires a certain mindset. But love isn't something that can be confined to formulas and experiments. It's lived and felt in the moments we share with others."

Kent smiled and looked out the window, the passing scenery a blur. "Maybe you're right. I've always approached everything analytically. But perhaps there's more to life than just understanding how things work. Perhaps there's value in experiencing and appreciating the mysteries we can't fully explain."

Isabella nodded, her gaze softening. "Love is one of those mysteries. It's what makes us human. It's worth pursuing, even if we don't have all the answers."

Their conversation was interrupted by a sudden jolt as the train began to slow down for a stop. The couple ahead of them parted, smiling at each other with a warmth that spoke volumes. Isabella watched them with a wistful expression.

"Look at them," she said quietly. "They're sharing something beautiful, something that science might explain but never fully capture."

Isabella turned back to her new student, her eyes shining. "Dr. Kent. Love is the force that gives life its meaning. It's the reason we strive, the reason we hope. And in the end, *love is the only thing worth dying for."* 

Kent felt a strange warmth in his chest, a feeling he couldn't quite explain. Perhaps it was the start of understanding, not just of love as a concept, but of the experience itself. He smiled at Isabella, grateful for her perspective.

"Thank you, Isabella. You've given me a lot to think about."

She smiled back. "I'm glad. Sometimes, the most important lessons come from the heart, not the mind."

Dr. Kent wanted to tell the beautiful artist that the heart is just a blood pumping organ, but he didn't want to ruin the beautiful conversation that she was engrossed in, or perhaps, he liked the smile on Isabella’s face and was afraid to lose it for a while. 

As the train continued its journey, Kent and Isabella settled into a comfortable silence, each lost in their thoughts. For Kent, the world had just become a little more complex, a little more beautiful, and a lot more intriguing.  
Isabella’s words were echoing in his scientific mind “Love is the only thing worth dying for".
