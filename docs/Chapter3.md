# Chapter 3 : The Chandrayan  
A tinkling chime from Dr. Kent's phone interrupted their engrossing conversation. He reached for the device, his eyes gleaming with excitement. "Ah, they've landed on the moon\!"

Isabella, without much enthusiasm, inquired, "Who landed on the moon this time?"

"It's the Indians. Well, not the humans, but their spacecraft, the Chandrayan," Dr. Kent explained. "India has become the first country to land on the south pole of the moon, the dark side of the moon, in fact. It's quite a challenging feat. What are your thoughts on this remarkable achievement of mankind?"

Isabella responded with a slight smile, her indifference apparent. **"It means nothing to me. I have no opinion on it, and I'm not particularly interested."**

Dr. Kent was momentarily taken aback but then chuckled, saying, "Ah, alright, Picasso."

Now it was Isabella's turn to be surprised. "So, you know?"

Dr. Kent grinned in response. "Of course, it's hard not to know what one of the greatest artists of all time had to say about the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969, one of the greatest achievements of science and mankind."

"May I ask why you're not impressed by the Chandrayan moon mission? We can find water on the moon, potentially usable as jet fuel when humans establish a lunar base," Dr. Kent inquired, his eyes reflecting his fascination with the scientific possibilities.

Isabella sighed softly, her gaze fixed on the passing landscape. "It's not that I don't appreciate the scientific advancements, but I can't help feeling that we have more pressing issues right here on Earth," she explained, her disappointment with the state of the world evident in her tone. "The space race, at times, feels like a global show-off contest among countries, with resources poured into endeavors beyond our planet while so many suffer from problems like climate change, poverty, lack of healthcare and education. Millions of people don't have access to drinking water. What is the outcome of such extravaganza on space missions ?"  

Dr. Kent nodded and paused for a moment, then said "let me tell you about the Apollo 11 mission in 1969\. It was a landmark event, driven in part by the Cold War rivalry, but it had far-reaching consequences beyond space exploration."

Isabella leaned in, her curiosity piqued. "What makes the Apollo 11 mission so significant?"

Dr. Kent explained, "Well, aside from the obvious achievement of landing humans on the moon, this mission triggered an unexpected revolution‚Äîthe computer revolution. In order to calculate the complex trajectories and make split-second decisions required for space travel, NASA had to develop cutting-edge computer technology. The advancements made in computer technology during the Apollo program led to the rapid enhancement of processor chips. It pushed the boundaries of what computers could do at an unprecedented rate. In essence, the intense pressure of the space race accelerated the information technology revolution." 

Isabella's eyes widened with realization. "So, the Apollo mission not only achieved a historic feat in space exploration but also played a pivotal role in shaping the technology landscape we know today?"

Dr. Kent nodded with enthusiasm. "Exactly, Isabella. The world witnessed unintended yet profound consequences. The Apollo mission opened the floodgates for the computer revolution, paving the way for the technological advancements that continue to shape our world. Now the world is run on computers. The medical and educational fields are heavily dependent on computers. In the 21st century, revolutions start on the Internet. That was the impact of the Apollo moon missions." 

Dr. Kent smiled and looked into the eyes of his co-passenger who was so engrossed that she couldn't hear the voice of the ticket master who was asking for the ticket.

"Ma'am, may I see your ticket?"

Isabella, completely absorbed in the riveting conversation, remained oblivious to the persistent calls of the ticket checker. It was only after his repeated requests that she suddenly snapped back to the present, her eyes widening in realization. She swiftly retrieved her ticket, apologizing with a touch of embarrassment, and handed it over to the checker. Dr. Kent, too, showed his ticket with a wry smile, acknowledging the captivating conversation that had momentarily swept them away.

As they discussed this historical event, Isabella gained a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of history, science, and technology, and how pivotal moments in the past could influence the present and future in unexpected ways.
